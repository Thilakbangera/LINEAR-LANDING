🚀 Linear Landing – Modern SaaS Landing Page

Welcome to Linear Landing, a modern and beautifully animated SaaS landing page built with React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and deployed on Netlify.  
This project was created as part of the AI Vibe Coder Internship Task (Task B) by ADmyBRAND.

> 🎯 Goal: Build a sleek, professional landing page that reflects cutting-edge design and user-first experience.

✅ About This Submission
I was shortlisted for the first round of the AI Vibe Coder (Founding Engineer) Internship at ADmyBRAND, and successfully moved forward to submit the task as part of the evaluation process.

This project — a Modern SaaS Landing Page & Component System — was developed in response to Task B, focusing on:

Building a clean, production-ready frontend using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

Designing reusable UI components with modern animations and transitions

Leveraging AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Copilot) to streamline the development process

Delivering a fully responsive, fast, and visually stunning user interface

The goal was not only to complete the task but to demonstrate real-world frontend engineering capabilities, speed of development using AI assistance, and an eye for user experience — all of which are critical in a fast-moving startup environment.

## 🧠 AI Usage Report

This project was independently developed with partial assistance from AI tools, contributing to approximately **25%** of the total workflow. AI support was used selectively to speed up repetitive tasks, validate design decisions, and streamline the development process. The core development — including component architecture, styling, and deployment — was handled manually to retain full creative control and ensure deep technical understanding.

🔧 AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4o)
  - Brainstormed UI structure and layout ideas
  - Provided Framer Motion animation snippets
  - Assisted with Netlify deployment configuration
  - Reviewed and refined README content
- GitHub Copilot
  - Auto-suggested React and Tailwind CSS code patterns
  - Helped with boilerplate and repetitive logic

🗂️ Example Prompts & Tasks
- `How to animate a component using Framer Motion in React`
- `Fix: Netlify build not working — what should be the publish directory?`
- `Write a clean, modern landing page structure with Tailwind CSS`
- `Professional README template for SaaS landing page`

💡 Summary
AI tools were used as supportive aids to improve speed and clarity, not as the main development drivers. This ensured originality, functionality, and hands-on understanding of every part of the project.
