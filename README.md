🚀 Linear Landing – Modern SaaS Landing Page

Welcome to Linear Landing, a modern and beautifully animated SaaS landing page built with React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and deployed on Netlify.  
This project was created as part of the AI Vibe Coder Internship Task (Task B) by ADmyBRAND.

> 🎯 Goal: Build a sleek, professional landing page that reflects cutting-edge design and user-first experience.

✅ About This Submission
I was shortlisted for the first round of the AI Vibe Coder (Founding Engineer) Internship at ADmyBRAND, and successfully moved forward to submit the task as part of the evaluation process.

This project — a Modern SaaS Landing Page & Component System — was developed in response to Task B, focusing on:

Building a clean, production-ready frontend using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

Designing reusable UI components with modern animations and transitions

Leveraging AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Copilot) to streamline the development process

Delivering a fully responsive, fast, and visually stunning user interface

The goal was not only to complete the task but to demonstrate real-world frontend engineering capabilities, speed of development using AI assistance, and an eye for user experience — all of which are critical in a fast-moving startup environment.
